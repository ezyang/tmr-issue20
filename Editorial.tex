\noindent\textit{It's not dead, it's resting!}

Awakening from its slumber, The Monad Reader shambles back to life with
three new articles for your perusal.  The authors in this issue have my
gratefulness for putting up with what ended up being a very long editing
cycle, and you, fair reader, have my thanks for waiting patiently.
Enjoy!
